# System Architecture

Based on MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. Use a
uniform language throughout our stack.

## MongoDB
Key Features
- High Performance

  MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,
    - Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.
    - Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.

- High Availability

  To provide high availability, MongoDBâ€™s replication facility, called replica sets, provide:
    - automatic failover.
    - data redundancy.

  A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data
  set, providing redundancy and increasing data availability.

- Automatic Scaling

  MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality.

    - Automatic sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
    - Replica sets can provide eventually-consistent reads for low-latency high throughput deployments.
